    "fullBio": "Rob Wienhoff didn't just stumble into the world of industrial coding and automation—he built his expertise through decades of hands-on experience, relentless curiosity, and a commitment to solving real manufacturing challenges. From early days tinkering with technology to leading complex integrations for Fortune 500 companies, Rob has developed a unique perspective: success isn't about the fanciest equipment, it's about understanding your process, your people, and your goals.\n\nWith decades of experience across pharmaceutical, food & beverage, and automotive manufacturing, Rob brings a systems-first approach to industrial coding and labeling. His consulting services cover every phase—line assessment, solution design, equipment selection, software integration, and operator training—so you get more than a device. You get a reliable, compliant, future-ready identification system.\n\nUnlike manufacturers locked into single-vendor relationships, Rob brings an independent perspective. His recommendations are based solely on what works best for your specific operation—not commission structures or brand loyalty. This vendor-neutral approach has saved clients millions in unnecessary upgrades while dramatically improving line efficiency, traceability, and compliance.",
